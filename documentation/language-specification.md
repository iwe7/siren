Mermaid
=======

> **This document is a work in progress.**

Mermaid is an experiment in interactive programming platforms, taking after the
Shell, Emacs, Lamdu, Pharo and similar previous work on interactive
platforms. The major difference is that Mermaid was originally designed as a
language for teaching programming in the web platform, so Mermaid's semantics
are fairly close to JavaScript's semantics.
