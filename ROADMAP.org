* Mermaid 1.0 - Seashore

The roadmap for the first release of Mermaid. It should include all of the
language's semantics, plus a working VM based on live objects (like
Pharo/Squeak/etc), and a visual IDE for working with those objects.

Eventually the idea is to separate this into a *server VM*, which takes care of
handling the live objects for us, and several *clients*, which can interact
with the server. The IDE would be a client, but the information from the VM
could also be used by text editors (like Emacs), external debuggers, etc.

** Language
*** TODO [#C] Don't inherit from ~Object.prototype~ by default
Currently all objects inherit from Object.prototype, implicitly. With the
current settings, this isn't a problem because there aren't many behaviours set
in ~Object.prototype~. This might change in the future, so it's interesting to
require people to explicitly inherit from ~Object.prototype~ instead.

If objects inherit from ~null~, they won't have a ~send-to:in:with:~ message
defined, however, so we'd need to define that for these objects as well.

*** TODO Add interfaces for structural contracts
Contracts would help with feedback in using objects in the system, and avoid
errors from sending incorrect messages to objects. I'm not quite sure how the
system could use this information to provide better feedback for the user yet
though, so it's something to think about.

*** TODO [#A] Have global bindings resolve as messages sent to the Global object
We should have Self's equivalent of ~Lobby~, a global namespace that's the
entrypoint for all objects in the system. Variables that don't exist in the
current namespace should be message sends to the global object.

We can move several things that are currently ad-hoc (e.g.: ~String~, ~Object~,
etc.) to this global namespace. It makes sense to have messages go
~Local Bindings -> Module -> Global~ as well.

*** TODO [#B] Allow expressions in ~extend~
The ~extend~ construct supports only literal objects for now, because it must
construct a mapping of message names to selector values. It would be
interesting to support arbitrary expressions that resolve to objects in this
construct, but we need to be able to gather all message names for the selector
values the object supports.

*** TODO Get rid of ~=~ in message definitions
It's not strictly necessary in the grammar, and we could have a cleaner
language overall, but it's mostly a cosmetic change, and I'm not sure it
delivers that much value.

*** TODO [#A] Allow rebinding names in ~using/use~
Currently there's no way of resolving namespacing conflicts when introducing
new message resolutions with ~using/use~. Allowing one to remap message names
when unpacking a particular trait in the namespace would solve this.

** Compiler
*** TODO Functions only need to be bound if they contain ~this~ expressions
Currently all lambda functions compile to ~(function(...){ ... }).bind(this)~,
which is unnecessary when ~this~ doesn't happen inside that expression. We can
avoid the overhead by having a simple pass where we revert the ~bound~ state of
the lambda if it doesn't use a ~this~ expression inside of it.

** Libraries
*** TODO Meta-data and Mirror-based reflection
Should allow people to add meta-data to an object, and query meta-data about
that object. Meta-data includes things like "which messages this object
responds to?", and "which objects does this object delegate to?" as well.
*** TODO IO and concurrency
For handling I/O and concurrency, Mermaid should provide:

- [ ] CSP channels
- [ ] Observable streams
- [ ] Task monad
- [ ] Future monad (memoised Task)
- [ ] Transducers
- [ ] High-level asynchronous combinators
*** TODO Operating system services
Should wrap the Node libraries for:

- [ ] Managing the current process and forking new ones;
- [ ] Dealing with the File System (making paths, files, and directories be plain objects)
- [ ] The OS library;  
*** TODO Collections
- [ ] Linked lists
- [ ] Vectors / Arrays
- [ ] Queues
- [ ] Stacks
- [ ] Maps
- [ ] Sets
*** TODO Networking
- [ ] HTTP / HTTPS
- [ ] Raw sockets
- [ ] Dealing with URLs as objects, rather than strings
*** TODO Graphical User Interface
- [ ] Component-based interfaces (like React)  
*** TODO Exception handling and other core libraries
- [ ] Maybe values
- [ ] Either values
- [ ] Validation values
- [ ] Better date handling (maybe wrap Moment.js)
- [ ] Wrapping all core JS objects
** Tooling
*** TODO VM-as-a-service
The VM should be a background server that can be queried by clients.
** VM
*** TODO VM snapshots and versioning
We need to be able to serialise the living objects and restore them. Versioning
in this would be essential for a robust solution, which basically means we'd
end up creating our own VCS :x
** IDE
*** TODO A ~nw.js~ based visual REPL
